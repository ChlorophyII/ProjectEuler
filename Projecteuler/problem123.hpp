//=========================== Problem 123 ===========================
//Title: Prime square remainders
/*
 Start date: 10/29/2016
 Finish date:

 Description:
 Let pn be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when (p_n−1)n + (p_n+1)n is divided by pn2.

 For example, when n = 3, p_3 = 5, and 43 + 63 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.

 The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^9 is 7037.

 Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^10.
