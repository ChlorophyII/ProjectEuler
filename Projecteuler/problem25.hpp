//=========================== Problem 25 ===========================
//Title: 1000-digit Fibonacci number
/*
 Start date: 3/29/2016
 Finish date: 3/29/2016
 
 Description:
 The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
 
 Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
 Hence the first 12 terms will be:
 
 F1 = 1
 F2 = 1
 F3 = 2
 F4 = 3
 F5 = 5
 F6 = 8
 F7 = 13
 F8 = 21
 F9 = 34
 F10 = 55
 F11 = 89
 F12 = 144
 The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
 
 What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
