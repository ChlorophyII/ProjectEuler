//=========================== Problem 28 ===========================
//Title: Number spiral diagonals
/*
 Start date: 4/8/2016
 Finish date: 4/8/2016
 
 Description:
 Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
 
 21 22 23 24 25
 20  7  8  9 10
 19  6  1  2 11
 18  5  4  3 12
 17 16 15 14 13
 
 It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
 
 What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
