//=========================== Problem 30 ===========================
//Title: Digit fifth powers
/*
 Start date: 4/8/2016
 Finish date: 4/8/2016
 
 Description:
 Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
 
 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
 8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
 9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
 As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.
 
 The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
 
 Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
