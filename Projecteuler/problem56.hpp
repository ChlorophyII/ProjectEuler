//=========================== Problem 56 ===========================
//Title: Powerful digit sum
/*
 Start date: 4/3/2016
 Finish date: 4/3/2016
 
 Description:
 A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
 
 Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?
