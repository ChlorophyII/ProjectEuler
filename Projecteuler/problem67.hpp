//=========================== Problem 67 ===========================
//Title: Maximum path sum II
/*
 Start date: 3/26/2016
 Finish date: 3/26/2016
 
 Description:
 By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
 
 3
 7 4
 2 4 6
 8 5 9 3
 
 That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
 
 Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

 NOTE: This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2^99 altogether! If you could check one trillion (10^12) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
