//=========================== Problem 77 ===========================
//Title: Prime summations
/*
 Start date: 4/3/2016
 Finish date: 4/3/2016
 
 Description:
 It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:
 
 7 + 3
 5 + 5
 5 + 3 + 2
 3 + 3 + 2 + 2
 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
 
 What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?
